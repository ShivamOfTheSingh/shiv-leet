# shiv-leet
A simple repo of all the leetcode problem I do

Each folder corresponds to the languages and the leetcodes I did for each of them
The `maker` file is a simple program that will make a fresh file given the Leetcode problem number
It uses a webscraper to collect the link and problem information which it places onto a new file
